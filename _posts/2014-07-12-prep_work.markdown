Tools Installation
===================

If you haven't already, make sure you've installed the following on your machine:

1. [Sublime Text 3][st3], a powerful, lightweight text editor
2. [Google Chrome][chrome], the browser you'll use for development
3. If you're on a Mac, [download the Xcode Command Line Tools from Apple][xcode].
4. [Git][git], a version-control system 
5. [SourceTree][sourcetree], an optional GUI for Git
6. Sign up for a [GitHub account][github]
 
[st3]: http://www.sublimetext.com/3
[chrome]: http://www.google.com/chrome/browser
[xcode]: http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/
[git]: http://git-scm.com/downloads
[sourcetree]: http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download
[github]: http://github.com

* Mac users: Place Terminal in your Dock
* Windows users: Place Git Bash (installed with Git) in your Start menu 


<!-- Setting up Terminal (Macs)


Copy and paste the following into Terminal:

{% highlight text %}
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/usr/local/bin/subl
echo "export EDITOR='subl -w'" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}

The first line will allow you to open Sublime Text from the command line by issuing `subl`. The second will make ST your default command-line text editor. -->



Preparation for the Course
=========================

You can start on these treehouse courses. Because some students join the class only a few days before class begins, we'll give you some time to complete them in the first weeks of class.

1. Watch [Console Foundations](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations-2) on Treehouse
1. Watch [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics) on Treehouse
1. Watch [How to Make a Website](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website)

Textbooks
=========

There is no *required* textbook for this class.  We will use online resources -- they tend to be more up to date and are much cheaper. 

However, there is a pair of books that several students *highly recommend* and that we use in the Web Front End course. They are very approachable and provide clear introductions to what can be very obscure topics. The HTML/CSS one is a year or two old, but still accurate, and the JavaScript one is very up to date and, in general, excellent. 

Here's a [link to them on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=asap_B001IR3Q7I_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1415837047&sr=1-1)

PCS doesn't make any money on this link.

I don't know of any legitimate sources of ebook versions. The layout of the books is so sumptuous, however, that you'll enjoy the paper version.

Pre-Course Assessment
======================

Before the first class meeting, complete the pre-course assessment. <br><br>

The assessment is meant primarily as a diagnostic to help the instructional staff see what areas we need to focus on during our in-person meetings.
